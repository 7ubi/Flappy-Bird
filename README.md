# Flappy-Bird
 
This is the game Flappy Bird I created using processing!

#How to use

In the Flappy Bird folder there's a Folder "application.windows64" (when you have a 64bit system) and "application.windows32" (when you have a 32bit system). Go in to the folder you need and run the file "Flappy_Bird.exe".
